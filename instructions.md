Tips for syntax (signs, paths, image vs video etc)
# 🛠️ Markdown Syntax Tips for Your Portfolio

Use these formatting rules when writing your docs:

---

## ✅ Screenshots

Paste like this:  
```md
![Alt text](screenshots/image-name.png)
✔️ Shows the image inline
⚠️ Do NOT add - [Link]() — that opens the image in a new tab only.

✅ Loom Video Links
Paste like this:- [Video Title](https://www.loom.com/share/your-link)
✔️ Renders a clean clickable title
⚠️ Do NOT use ![]() or it will show a broken icon.


✅ Internal Links
To link to other .md files inside your repo:
[Team Roles](project-docs/team-roles.md)

✅ Section Headers
Use ## or ### to organize your docs into sections:
## 📹 Video Walkthroughs  
### 🟢 User Story 1


✅ Checklist
Great for tasks:
- [x] Create Jira Epic  
- [ ] Add User Story


✅ Tables
Use pipes (|) to format tables:
| Name | Role         |
|------|--------------|
| Alex | Admin        |
That’s it! Keep this file handy in all your repos so you never forget the right signs.
